# Timeout Configuration Guide

## Production Deployment Fixes

This document outlines the changes made to fix timeout errors for complex AI queries in production.

## Problem
- Vercel Hobby plan has a 10-second timeout limit for Server Actions
- Complex AI queries were timing out, returning 504 errors
- Users couldn't process longer or more detailed farming questions

## Solution Implemented

### 1. API Route Conversion
- ✅ Converted from Server Action to API Route (`/api/farmers-assistant`)
- ✅ API routes support longer execution times (up to 30 seconds)
- ✅ Better error handling and timeout management

### 2. Timeout Configuration
- ✅ Set `maxDuration = 30` in the API route
- ✅ Added Vercel function configuration in `vercel.json`
- ✅ Implemented internal timeout with Promise.race() pattern

### 3. Optimizations
- ✅ Limited OpenAI response tokens to 2000 to reduce processing time
- ✅ Enhanced error messages for different timeout scenarios
- ✅ Added request duration logging for monitoring

### 4. Error Handling Improvements
- ✅ Specific timeout error messages
- ✅ Better user feedback for different error types
- ✅ Fallback strategies for network issues

## Files Modified

1. **`app/api/farmers-assistant/route.ts`** - New API route with extended timeout
2. **`app/(protected)/farmers-assistant/page.tsx`** - Updated to use API route
3. **`vercel.json`** - Added function timeout configuration

## Benefits

- ✅ **Extended Processing Time**: Up to 30 seconds instead of 10
- ✅ **Better Error Handling**: Specific messages for different timeout scenarios  
- ✅ **Improved UX**: Users get clear feedback about what went wrong
- ✅ **Production Ready**: Proper Vercel configuration for deployment

## Testing

1. **Local Development**: Test with complex queries locally
2. **Production**: Deploy and verify timeout improvements
3. **Monitoring**: Check logs for duration and error patterns

## Next Steps (Optional)

For even longer processing times, consider:
- Implementing background job processing
- Adding real-time progress indicators
- Chunking very large responses
- Implementing streaming responses
